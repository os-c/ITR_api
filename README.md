# ITR Portflio Alignment Tool

Under the hood, this API uses the ITR Python module. The complete structure that consists of a Python module, API and a UI looks as follows:

## Structure
The folder structure for this project is as follows:

    .
    ├── .github                 # Github specific files (Github Actions workflows)
    ├── app                     # FastAPI app files for the API endpoints
    └── config                  # Config files for the Docker container

## Deployment
In order to run the docker container locally or non linux machines one needs to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) available for Mac and Windows

### API-only

In order to run a locally build version run:

For building the image the codes relies on source-to-image (s2i). Please install s2i first. the CLI can be found [here](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/releases/). Make sure the install location is added to the PATH variable.
```bash
s2i build . registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/python-38 -e APP_FILE=app/main.py [YOUR REPO]/[NAME]:[YOUR_TAG] -c
```
- the build is based in the UBI 8 Python 3.8 base images.
- '-e APP_FILE=app/main.py' directs s2i to the applications that needs to run
- '-c' makes s2i build your local code version. When removed it will build the latest committed git stage
